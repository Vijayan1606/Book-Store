## Install Dependencies
The project consists of two parts: the frontend (React) and the backend (Node.js + Express)
1. **Backend Setup (Node.js + Express)**:
- Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```
2.**Frontend Setup (React)**:
- Navigate to the frontend directory
```bash
cd frontend
npm create vite@latest my-project 
cd my-project
```
3.**Frontend Setup (Tailwand CSS)**:
- Install tailwindcss and its peer dependencies, then generate your tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js files.
```
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p

```
## Configure the Backend
- Set up environment variables:
- In the backend folder, create a .env file with the following contents
```
PORT = 1000
URI = mongodb+srv://muthuvijayan1606:Vijay@bookstore.3rsps.mongodb.net/bookecommerce
```
## Configure the Frontend
- Add the paths to all of your template files in your tailwind.config.js file.
```
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```
- Add the @tailwind directives for each of Tailwindâ€™s layers to your ./src/index.css file.
```
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
